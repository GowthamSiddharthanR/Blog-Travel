                                <p>Pondicherry, or Puducherry, is famously known as the French Riviera of the East, and is one of the most mesmerizing and charming places in South India. A former French colony, this quaint little town has retained its old-world French charm. 8000 kilometers away from France, Pondicherry comes very close to giving you a feel of the French culture and the French influence is very obvious in the city right from the food to the architecture.</p><br></br>
                                <p>When I think of Pondicherry, a picture of the promenade along the Rock beach is what comes to my mind. Rock beach or Promenade beach is located in the heart of the city and is one of the top tourist attractions in Pondicherry. It is about a 1.2 km long stretch that starts from the War Memorial and ends at the Dupleix Park on Goubert Avenue. Right in the middle of the promenade is the magnificent statue of Gandhiji. </p><br></br>
                                <p>This four-meter high statue made of black stone is surrounded by 8 granite pillars, which were supposedly brought from a small fort near Pondicherry, Gingee. The space in front of the statue plays host to various cultural and musical activities throughout the year. The promenade is a no-vehicle zone from 5 in the evening to early morning, making it the perfect place to spend your evenings.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Most of the lovely peoples are living here, The majority of people in Puducherry are Hindu, with Muslims being a significant minority in Karaikal, Mahe, and Yanam. There are also some Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains.</p><br></br>

                                <p>White Town is home to some of the cutest looking buildings and the whole place seems like it is stuck in a time. As the name suggests, this area was reserved for the white (French) people back in the day. It is a very well planned area and this is where you can find the bright yellow and white walls, arched gates lined with bougainvillea, and clean European-style streets. It is also home to some of the best restaurants and cafes in Pondi and taking a stroll through White Town is a must for any person visiting Pondicherry.</p><br></br>
                                <p>The White Town is flanked by South Boulevard, Sardar Valabhai Patel Salai, HM Kassim Salai & Goubert Avenue on the sea side. In my walking spree I make a few stops as and when I come across them in this part of Pondicherry. Some I make momentary pause for others I take little more time. The old lighthouse, Joan Arc Park, Old Court Complex and a multitude of old buildings that can be a photographer's delight.</p><br></br>
                                <p>On next day, went to Auroville wants to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities. The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity.</p><br></br>
                                <p>The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity - in diversity. Today Auroville is recognised as the first and only internationally endorsed ongoing experiment in human unity and transformation of consciousness.</p><br></br>
                                <p>About 4,000 people from more than 50 different countries now live in Auroville. They are mostly foreigners who came to India during the Cold War years looking for a peaceful place to live, although today there are many young people born and raised here.</p><br></br>
