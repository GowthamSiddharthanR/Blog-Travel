                                <p>Around 6:30 AM, we started from Attur to Kollimalai. There are several routes that Google maps would recommend; often through the mud roads to Kollimalai. Please do point to a specific location in Kollimalai like a viewpoint or the most popular Arapaleeswarar temple rather than typing as Kolli Hills. The most important point to note is that the ghat road with 70 hairpin bends is the most exciting part of the journey. Do follow the route recommended at the top of the blog for the best experience.</p><br></br>
                                <p>We reached Karavalli around 8 AM. A few km before Karavalli, in a small village named Nadukombai, we had breakfast. Hot piping idlies, freshly prepared parottas with sides of Sambhar, 2 chutneys, and veg kurma were fantastic. There are few small shops at Karavalli as well. From Karavalli, the forest check-post lets you to the ghat section of the trip. If one misses Karavalli, you cannot get anything to eat or drink until you reach the top.</p><br></br>
                                <p>The climb is only 21 km to Solakkadu but, through 70 hairpin bends! The roads are fantastic and the whole ride is exciting to see around as well as to drive. Hardly, there are spaces to stop the vehicle to see around apart from 5 - 7 places in the stretch - do stop wherever you see space allowing free movement of other vehicles and enjoy the views.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Kollimalai is the name of the hill area and it has a number of villages. Most importantly, as a tourist, one needs to know a couple of names - Solakkadu and Semmedu. Almost all the tourist spots, hotels, and resorts are located around these 2 places. The 34th hairpin bend is very popular to stop by for a view of roads below. This is a nice viewpoint and normally all tourists stop here.</p><br></br>
                                <img src="https://www.tripplannersindia.com/assets/images/postimages/Aagaya_Gangai_Waterfalls.webp" /><br></br>
                                <p>Agaya Gangai Waterfalls is 1 km walk down from the sides of the temple. The main attraction of Kolli Hills. One has to climb down (and back) 1302 steps to reach the falls. The steps are steep and can get very tiring. It takes approximately 30 mins to climb-down to the falls and 1 hr to climb-up back. Agaya Gangai waterfalls are the attraction of Kolli hills. Waterfalls from 300 feet of height and is an amazing view. The waterfalls on either the rocks or the pond like place near the rocks based on the water flow. One needs to get into the pond of water to get wet in the waterfalls. A rope is tied leading people through the pond towards the waterfalls for safety.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Definitely, a great place! We spent around 45 minutes in water. Do take snacks when you go down. Once you are out of the water, you would feel hungry and need lots and lots of energy to make it back to the top across 1000+ steps!</p><br></br>
                                <p>Once we reached the top, vegetarian food was available around Arapaleeshwar Temple. We next visited, in 1 km from Arapaleeshwar Temple, Valappurnadu View Point. There is a view tower and gives amazing views from the top. The rich colors of Kolli hills and the blue sky make it a wow viewpoint. Do not miss this place whenever you visit the Arapaleeswar temple.</p><br></br>
                                <p>My non-veg loving friends tried to have some non-veg food near the junction coming out of Agaya Gangai falls; however, it is cooked on pre-orders only. They did get some egg stuff, however. We decided to go around the Kolli hills via Arippilappatti - Selurnadu - Vasalur Patti - The hill road. The road was mostly less used apart from a few locals and a rare bus we could see. The views at few places were quite good, mostly covered with agriculture and pepper vines all around. We did stop in a couple of places to feel belonging to nature as much as we could! Overall, around a 1-hour drive before we reached the main tourist area.</p><br></br>
                                <p>If you're feeling lost, stuck, or like you've drifted from your core, travel can be a potent reset. Let the transformative power of new landscapes, cultures, and spiritual experiences be the catalysts to reignite your fire and remember your magic. Lose yourself in the beauty and wisdom of this world, and you'll inevitably find yourself again.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Love,</p><br></br>
