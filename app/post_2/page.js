                                <p>The temple of Tiruvannamalai, or Arunachalaleswarar Temple, occupies an area of 10 hectares and is one of the largest temples in India, with Gopuram up to 66 meters high. I immediately notice that the Gopurams are not colored, as I had seen in some photos, but off-white, which makes them much less showy. Pandi, my guide, explains the temples are colored with bright colors but in time the weather discolor them. That is why the faithful are often asked to pay offers to repaint them.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Outside the temple, near the Gopuram of Thirumanjana, the streets are filled with flower stalls and votive offerings. All the faithful buy something to offer at the foot of some sacred statue. This rite is called Puja and it consists of a series of offerings, gestures and mantras to be recited at the feet of sacred statues in order to obtain a personal benefit more wealth, more health, more love etc.There is also a cotton candy seller to delight children!</p><br></br>
                                <p>At the entrance we are asked to take off our shoes and not to take pictures of the altars. I walk inside the temple and wander among the colonnades and altars scattered in the inner area. It is easy to identify where the central shrine is located: there is a very long line to access it. Women with colorful saris, their hair gathered and braided with flowers, greet me and smile when I approach. I photograph them and laugh. Here everyone laughs. As soon as the eyes meet, the eyes sparkle and the mouth reveals very white teeth. Indians are beautiful: in their faces there is all the life of the world.</p><br></br>
                                <p>At the center is the large lingam, a phallic-shaped statue representing an avatar of Shiva. Legend has it that right on Mount Arunachala, where Tiruvannamalai rises, Shiva appeared with the appearance of a big fire phallus to restore light to the world, after his wife Parvati had made him fall into darkness closing his eyes. If it seems this story makes no sense, well, there are many more anecdotes of quarrels and spite between the two spouses!</p><br></br>

                                <p>Nestled to the north-west of Tiruvannamalai, the Jawadhu Hills form a picturesque setting that’s ripe for exploration. This lesser-known sanctuary is home to a variety of flora and fauna typical of the Eastern Ghats. Visitors can spot indigenous species such as the Indian bison, spotted deer, and a plethora of bird species like bulbuls, pigeons, and the striking peacock. The dense forests, interspersed with tranquil streams and waterfalls, offer a refreshing retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Just a short drive from the heart of Tiruvannamalai, the Sathanur Dam area is renowned not only for its impressive engineering feat but also for its surrounding reserve forest. This area is a biodiversity hotspot where you can observe the dynamics of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Look out for the crocodiles basking on the banks of the dam or the occasional elephant quenching its thirst. The forest around the dam is teeming with macaques, wild boars, and various exotic birds.</p><br></br>
                                <p>The path around the base of Arunachala Hill offers more than just a spiritual pilgrimage; it’s a chance to immerse yourself in the local natural environment. The 14-kilometre walk is lined with medicinal herbs and vibrant wildflowers, attracting butterflies and birds, creating a melody of chirps and the flutter of wings. It’s a gentle, accessible walk that offers moments of peace and introspection, alongside opportunities for bird watching and plant identification.</p><br></br>
                                <p>For those who enjoy a bit of history with their nature walks, the trails around Gingee Fort are perfect. Located about 40 kilometres from Tiruvannamalai, these trails offer a rugged terrain that contrasts with the verdant forested areas closer to the town. The fort itself is perched on three hillocks, and the surrounding areas are dotted with scrub and rock-dwelling flora and fauna, offering a different perspective on the region’s natural beauty.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Tiruvannamalai’s natural landscapes offer a unique blend of spiritual and ecological tourism. From the dense forests of Jawadhu Hills to the historic paths around Gingee Fort, each site presents an opportunity to connect with nature in a deeply personal way. Whether you choose a structured guided tour or an impromptu nature walk, the flora and fauna of this region promise to enrich your travels with breathtaking views and serene moments.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Ready to lace up your hiking boots and delve into the natural beauty surrounding Tiruvannamalai? Whether it's the wildlife sanctuaries or the serene nature trails, this journey is sure to be one of enlightenment and enchantment.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Love,</p><br></br>
