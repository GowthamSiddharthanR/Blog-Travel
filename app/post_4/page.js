                                <p>The culture of Ladakh is as beautiful as its scenic view. The main religion followed in Ladakh is Buddhism and thus Ladakh’s culture is heavily influenced by Buddhism. The people of Ladakh are down-to-earth and jolly by nature. They celebrate their festivals passionately and enthusiastically. The major festivals of Ladakh are celebrated in monasteries. A special and unique trait of the people of Ladakh worth mentioning is their sense of community. </p><br></br>
                                <p>Ladakh has a rich culture and tradition and another amazing thing to explore while in Ladakh is folk music and dance. Chaam is one of the most famous dance forms of Ladakh, it is also called mask dance. Chaam metaphorically denotes the victory of good over evil. Other popular dance forms of Ladakh are Khatok and Chenmo. One can get a glimpse of this beautiful dance at any of the big festivals of Ladakh-Losar and Hemis Tsechu festivals.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Along with dance and music, Ladakh has spectacular Art and Craft. People of Ladakh create many artifacts for religious purposes such as teacup stands, chang pots, bowls, and ladles. You'll be happy to know that women in Ladakh have great craftsmanship in creating Pattu, a cloth created from wool and drop spindles. One can spot unique portable looms here on which weaving takes place. Tourists usually buy the baskets sold in the local market made from willow twigs.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Ladakh's culture is rich and diverse, with influences from Tibet, India, and other regions. Ladakhi cuisine is influenced by Tibetan cooking traditions, and includes dishes like thukpa, momos, and tigmo. Popular dance forms include Chaam, Khatok, and Chenmo. Chaam, also known as the mask dance, symbolizes the victory of good over evil.</p><br></br>

                                <p>The Chadar trek starts from a point where the current road ends, somewhere between Chilling and Tilad Sumdo. The 7-days trekking route (with a buffer day) goes upto a village called Nerak and back. The trekking distance for Chadar trek from Chilling to Nerak and back is around 105 kms, requiring 15-16 kms of walk per day. This trek is almost a flat walk starting an altitude of 3170m and reaching the higher camp at Nerak at 3400m. However, it is considered to be a difficult trek due to the harsh weather conditions. Thorough physical as well as mental preparation for Chadar Trek is highly recommended.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Chadar Trek was my first ever experience of coming face to face with climate crisis and the effects of global warming. Chadar trek in Ladakh is a unique experience for adventure seekers for its glamorous frozen river trail crossing through frozen ice sheets, ice slides, waterfalls and caves on Zanskar river. Traditionally this trail has been used by the locals of Ladakh for trade as it is the only option connecting Leh to Zanskar Valley in the winter when the river forms thick ice sheets on the surface.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Chadar Trek - Frozen River Trek in Ladakh is one of the most glamorous treks in the world. It is considered to be extremely difficult because you have to trek on the frozen Zanskar river in winter when the temperature ranges between -15°C and -30°C. Though the walk is simple, with no ascend, this trek brings it's own set of difficulties. The temperatures are beyond human tolerance.</p><br></br>
                                <p>Markha Valley Trek in Ladakh is a gorgeous trekking route with the most colourful mountains of Ladakh and the Ladakhi cultural experiences. On one of my initial treks to Roopkund, I had got inspired by a French lady who was trekking alone with a guide. Solo Trekking then became high on my priority list</p><br></br>
                                <p>Ladakh, the land of high passes, is the topmost road trip destination in India. But, for me, Ladakh was only about trekking when I’d ever thought of traveling to the outlandish Trans-Himalayan range.</p><br></br>
