                            <p>Kerala’s Hindu temples are famous for their beautiful design, which blends local styles with the traditional Dravidian architecture from Southern India. Their detailed artwork and thoughtful placement in nature show a special mix of influences. These temples often have a unique roof that slopes down in layers and is covered with copper. This design is not only good for when it rains a lot, but it also has a deeper meaning. The layers lead up to the most sacred part of the temple, where the main god is honored.</p><br></br>
                            <p>The walls and pillars of these temples are like storybooks, with sculptures that bring to life old Hindu stories and local legends. This shows how skilled the artists were back then and how much thought they put into their religion. The way the temples are set up is also very intentional, using the stars and the Earth’s energy as guides. This makes the temple a map of the universe, carved in stone and wood.</p><br></br>
                            <p>To really appreciate how these temples bring together art, nature, and spirituality, let’s take the example of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram. It’s known for its towering gateways, intricate carvings, and the massive stone pillars that tell stories from the sacred texts. What makes it special is not just its visual beauty but also its representation of the universe, making it a place of worship and a work of art.</p><br></br>
                            <p>Kerala is full of festivals that show off its unique religious and cultural traditions. These festivals take place at Hindu temples, which are the heart of these events. There’s a wide range of festivals, each with its own importance and special god or goddess.</p><br></br>
                            <p>Take the Thrissur Pooram festival as an example. It’s famous for its impressive elephant parades and big fireworks shows. When you look at these festivals closely, you see a planned sequence of happenings. For instance, people spend a lot of time getting the temple carts ready for parades, decorating with flowers in detailed patterns, and playing traditional music. These events do more than just support religious beliefs; they also bring people from different backgrounds together in Kerala.</p><br></br>

                            <p>I romanced with nature in Wayanad in the monsoons and lived in Asia's highest tree house located at 88ft above the ground. I’m a very romantic person, and yes that’s a secret to all. I romance with myself, red wine, cinnamon lemon tea, cheese cakes, music, dance, badminton and nature. Aren’t these the things one should really be in love with? I’m in the best of my moods when I’m out into the wild, closest to nature, closest to purity, closest to God.</p><br></br>
                            <p>Varkala, the only cliff by the beach in Kerala, is a fantastic backpacking destination for its laid-back and serene vibe. I had to cancel a trek of mine twice to handle some issues at work and these aren't the best times of my life. The frustration started building up and I had to make a quick escape to nature. Kerala seemed to be a good choice as the monsoon was ending and this is when the "God's own country" shines in the best of colors.</p><br></br>
                            <p>These temples help keep Kerala’s history and religious practices alive for the people who will come after us. They are like living history books that tell us about Kerala’s spiritual beliefs and the stories from the past.</p><br></br>
                            <p>Love,</p><br></br>
